git clone (line of created repository)
git add . -> any changes made need to add in main branch 
git status -> to check the status of overall changes 
git commit -m "message" -> for the committing the code changes
git push origin main -> for pushing the commited code into origin of main branch
git init 

 unable to auto-detect email address (got 'ADMIN@LAPTOP-17PDF78F.(none)')
Above solution -> then your solution for this is
$ git config --global user.email "kundangupta0807@gmail.com"

after this we can push our code using command point -> 5

created local text.file in local directories and want to save in repository created inside git hub (this is use for making local to github connection)
command -> $ git remote add origin "repository _link"       (explaination - making the connection between home to shop)

git clone link_repository  -> this will make the connection from shop to home

$ touch test1.file    ->this will create test file in github repository 
after this above command 
use command 1. git add .
			2. git commit -m "message"
			3.git push origin main

git pull origin main -> pulling the code from previous person commit changes maded
gitbash is a terminal to run github


changing from master branch to main branch
command -> git branch -M main

if we want to do whatever push or pull then first we have to use add command 
git add .

command  -> rm -rf .git  :- use for disconnect from the main branch



Branch concept :
1.git branch branch_name :- creating branch 
2.git checkout branch_name :- changing from main brach to development branch
3.git branch --list :- getting the list of branch
4.git add . && git commit -m "committing the branch"
5. git push origin branch_name_in_which_you_are_working
